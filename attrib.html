"Modern Jazz Samba"
<br>
Instruments: Kit, Bass, Acoustic Guitar, Piano, Flute
<br>
Feel: Bright, Driving, Bouncy
<br>
A nice little 85 BMP piece with guitar,
<br>
piano, bass, and flute. Kind of jazzy
<br>
and slightly blues-y with a more rocking beat.
<br>
The bass in this piece is actually a sample
<br>
from an 18th century double bass.
